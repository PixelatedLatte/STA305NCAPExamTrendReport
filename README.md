# STA305FinalProject

Showcase your inner data scientist

Pick a dataset, any dataset…
…and do something with it. That is your final project in a nutshell. More details below.
May be too long, but please do read

The final project for this class will consist of analysis on a dataset of your own choosing. The dataset may already exist, or you may collect your own data using a survey or by conducting an experiment. You can choose the data based on your interests or based on work in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.

The goal is not to do an exhaustive data analysis i.e., do not calculate every statistic and procedure you have learned for every variable, but rather let me know that you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them with results of data analysis, that you are proficient in using R, and that you are proficient at interpreting and presenting the results. Focus on methods that help you begin to answer your research questions. You do not have to apply every statistical procedure we learned (and you can use techniques we haven’t officially covered in class, if you’re feeling adventurous). Also, critique your own methods and provide suggestions for improving your analysis. Issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data, and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should be discussed here.

The project is very open ended. You should create some kind of compelling visualization(s) of this data in R. There is no limit on what tools or packages you may use, but sticking to packages we learned in class (tidyverse) is required. You do not need to visualize all of the data at once. A single high quality visualization will receive a much higher grade than a large number of poor quality visualizations. Also pay attention to your presentation. Neatness, coherency, and clarity will count. All analyses must be done in RStudio, using R.
Data

In order for you to have the greatest chance of success with this project it is important that you choose a manageable dataset. This means that the data should be readily accessible and large enough that multiple relationships can be explored. As such, your dataset must have at least 50 observations and between 10 to 20 variables (exceptions can be made but you must speak with me first). The dataset’s variables should include categorical variables, discrete numerical variables, and continuous numerical variables.

If you are using a dataset that comes in a format that we haven’t encountered in class, make sure that you are able to load it into R as this can be tricky depending on the source. If you are having trouble ask for help before it is too late.

Note on reusing datasets from class: Do not reuse datasets used in examples, homework assignments, or labs in the class.

Project Report

    Section 1 - Introduction: The introduction should introduce your general research question and your data (where it came from, how it was collected, what are the cases, what are the variables, etc.).

    Section 2 - Data analysis: The outcome (response, Y) and predictor (explanatory, X) variables you will use to answer your question. Preliminary exploratory data analysis, including some summary statistics and visualizations, along with some explanation on how they help you learn more about your data. The method(s) that you believe will be useful in answering your question(s). What results from these specific statistical methods are needed to support your hypothesized answer?
